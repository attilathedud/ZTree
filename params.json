{"name":"Ztree","tagline":"A python graphing tool that constructs network graphs of Z-Games","body":"# ZTree\r\n<div></div>\r\n\r\n##About\r\nZTree is a python graphing tool that constructs network graphs of Z-Machine games (http://inform-fiction.org/zmachine/). It is packaged with a slimmed-down version of Mark Howell's ZTools to dump the game files. A helper script can be found in the \"Scripts\" directory and is supposed to be run from there like so:\r\n```\r\n./dump_game ../Games/awaken.z5\r\n```\r\n\r\nDumps of the following games are already provided (as they were used for testing):\r\n- Adventureland\r\n- awaken\r\n- happy\r\n\r\nThese dumps (specifically the object files) are then passed into the ZTree.py parser like follows:\r\n```\r\npython ZTree.py -o ../Dumps/awaken.z5_object_dump -n 1,2,3,4,6,19,20,21,22,23,118,125 -d 1\r\n\r\npython ZTree.py -o ../Dumps/Adventureland.z5_object_dump -n 2,4,6\r\n\r\npython ZTree.py -o ../Dumps/happy.z5_object_dump -n 1,2,4,6,19,20,21,22,24 -d 3\r\n```\r\n\r\nZTree then uses Matplotlib to display an interactive version of the networked graph of nodes.\r\n\r\nUsage options are as follows:\r\n```\r\nusage: ZTree.py -o <object_file> -n <node1,node2,node3>\r\n\r\nZTree version 1.0 - maps Infocom story files into a directional graph. By Nathan Tucker.\r\n\r\n\t-o, --objects\tpath to object file (from infodump -o)\r\n\t-s, --siblings\tdisplay sibling relations (default false)\r\n\t-n, --nodes\tcomma-separated list of nodes to ignore\r\n\t-d, --display\tdisplay all nodes(0), only rooms(1), only objects(2), objects in rooms(3)\r\n\r\nexample: ZTree.py -o ../Dumps/awaken.z5 -n 1,4,6,118,125\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe different display modes are shown above.\r\n\r\n##Source\r\nZTree is licensed under the Apache License, so feel free to play around with the source.
